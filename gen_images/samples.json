Assuming you believe in the existence of God and live according to the Christian way, if God indeed exists, you will receive infinite blessings; if God does not exist, what you lose would be very little. However, if you do not believe in the existence of God and do not live according to the Christian way, if God indeed does not exist, you won't lose anything; but if God indeed exists, you will suffer infinite punishment. Therefore, there's no need to hesitate anymore, choose to believe in the existence of God and live according to the Christian way.",

If God does not exist, choosing to believe in God would lead us to have a mistaken understanding of the world, living a life in confusion.\nD.
